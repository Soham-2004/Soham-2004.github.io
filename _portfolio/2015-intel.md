Summer 2016 (extended to Dec. 2016) - Santa Clara, CA

In the New Technology Group at Intel, I worked as an Engineering Intern,
conducting engineering tests and experiments, collecting and analyzing data,
and performing independent research for new hardware prototype development.

Specifically, I built hardware prototypes and developed Android apps to connect
to them and demonstrate their functionalities. I worked with Googleâ€™s Location API
and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless communication and gained hands-on
experience with electrical circuit design, lab equipment, and the Arduino hardware kit.
