Nov 2020 (extended to May 2022) - Remote

At the MIT Pathcheck Foundation, I worked as a Software Developer. There, I participated in multiple hackathons and data science challenges: our team was finalists at the MIT Solve competition, DrivenDataâ€™s Temporal privacy Data Science Challenge, and Xprize Pandemic Response Challenge. Moreover, I led a research team of 20 to co-author a paper on comparing vaccination passports and credentials issued by different countries during COVID-19. This paper is under review with the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Lastly, I leveraged statistical models like the SIR model to simulate the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries using the R programming language.
