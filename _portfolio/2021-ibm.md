May 2021 (extended to Feb. 2022) - New Delhi, India

In the IBM Research Lab, I worked as an Engineering Intern,
conducting engineering tests and experiments, collecting and analyzing data,
and performing independent research for new software prototype development.

Specifically, I worked with EmancipAction - a foundation in Mumbai, India, that homes victims of human trafficking. I contributed towards building an AI-assisted framework, powered by IBM Watson, that allows young girls at Emancipation to converse with a mental health chatbot in Hindi, English and Kannada.
We used a machine learning algorithm to enable emotion recognition to the chatbot and help us monitor the participantsâ€™ mental health - based on a variety of parameters identified by psychologists. Further, we set up a hotline on the chatbot application for emergency assistance.
