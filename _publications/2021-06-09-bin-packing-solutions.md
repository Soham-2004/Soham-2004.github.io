excerpt: 'In this paper, we discuss the mathematical formulation of the bin packing problem. Furthermore, we analyse its approximate solutions' time complexity, its NP-Hardness and some of its stochastic solutions with their efficiencies. We then propose additional complexities that would make the problem more fit for industrial use and discuss in depth the domains in which it might prove to be useful. We conclude while suggesting areas of improvement in operations research on this subject.'
