excerpt: 'Graph embedding algorithms are used by researchers to automate feature engineering, allowing them to effectively utilise the information provided by large-scale knowledge graphs. In the field of cybersecurity, large-scale threat ontologies - where vertices and edges represent entities and their relations - can be inferred via Natural Language Processing on a wide array of sources. In this paper, we propose Weighted Walk, a graph embedding algorithm that uses a scoring function to utilise the confidence scores associated with the triplets in the cybersecurity ontology, to generate more semantically meaningful feature vectors.'

Graph embedding algorithms are used by researchers to automate feature engineering, allowing them to effectively utilise the information provided by large-scale knowledge graphs. In the field of cybersecurity, large-scale threat ontologies - where vertices and edges represent entities and their relations - can be inferred via Natural Language Processing on a wide array of sources. In this paper, we propose Weighted Walk, a graph embedding algorithm that uses a scoring function to utilise the confidence scores associated with the triplets in the cybersecurity ontology, to generate more semantically meaningful feature vectors.
