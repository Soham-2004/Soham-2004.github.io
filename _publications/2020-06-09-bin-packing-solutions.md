excerpt: 'Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) help in aggregating information about cyber-events. CKGs have assertions in the form of semantic triples. The triples describe a relationship between a subject and object, both of which are cybersecurity entities. In this paper, we describe a novel method that associates a score with the semantic triples asserted in the CKG using deep learning. We use semantic triples that we know are correct, in a supervised machine learning algorithm that produces the output for each relationship. In particular, we use Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) on a dataset of CKGs that can be used to ascertain the scores for each semantic triple.'

First authored paper accepted to the Journal of Medical Internet Research(JMIR).

Adverse drug events (ADEs) are unintended side effects of drugs that cause substantial clinical and economic burdens globally. A wealth of information, which facilitates ADE discovery, lies in the growing body of biomedical literature. Knowledge graphs (KGs) encode this information from the literature, where the vertices and the edges represent clinical concepts and their relations, respectively. In this paper, we use confidence scores during representation learning, so that the learned embeddings yield better features for ADE prediction models.
