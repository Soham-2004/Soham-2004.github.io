Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) help in aggregating information about cyber-events. CKGs have assertions in the form of semantic triples. The triples describe a relationship between a subject and object, both of which are cybersecurity entities. In this paper, we describe a novel method that associates a score with the semantic triples asserted in the CKG using deep learning. We use semantic triples that we know are correct, in a supervised machine learning algorithm that produces the output for each relationship. In particular, we use Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) on a dataset of CKGs that can be used to ascertain the scores for each semantic triple.
