I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and B.E.M (Business, Economics, and Management) at the [California Institute of Technology(Caltech)](https://caltech.edu). My interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and economics. In specific, I am interested in the applications of machine learning to other interdisciplinary fields. Previously, I have done research projects in the fields of healthcare, cybersecurity, and statistical modelling.


On-going Projects
------
In the upcoming winter of 2023, I will be undertaking the role of a Machine Learning Engineer at [OddsJam](https://oddsjam.com/) in Pasadena, CA. My primary focus will be on devising sophisticated sports betting models through statistical and data-centric computational approaches to unearth lucrative market niches. I will be contributing to the improvement of the OddsJam database, employing cutting-edge data analytics and machine learning strategies to refine sportsbook odds and bolster data fidelity. Furthermore, I will engage in collaborative efforts with multidisciplinary teams to weave machine learning insights into the OddsJam platform, thereby advancing betting methodologies and amplifying user engagement.

Work Experience
------
Over the years, I have primarily worked on interdisciplinary AI. During the onset of the pandemic in 2020, I worked at the [MIT PathCheck Foundation](https://www.pathcheck.org/) as a Software Developer. I worked on using statistical modelling to study the spread of COVID-19 in different countries and the efficacy of different governmental measures. I also led research team of 20 to analyze global COVID control and monetary strategies as well as the vaccination credential issued by various countis.

In addition, I interned at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com) in May 2021. I worked with IBM researchers and psychologists from EmancipAction - a foundation in Mumbai, India, that homes
victims of human trafficking. I contributed towards building an AI-assisted framework, powered by IBM Watson, that allows young girls at Emancipation to converse with a mental health chatbot in Hindi, English and Kannada. 

Moreover, I worked at the [NVIDIA AI Lab](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) with [Prof. Anima Anandkumar](https://eas.caltech.edu/people/anima) and [Prof. Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://kamyar.page) on using neural operators for Functional Ultrasound Imaging. I was working on developing a novel algorithm using Partial Differential Equations to learn power Doppler reconstruction functions from sparse sequences of ultrasound data of rat brain images.
