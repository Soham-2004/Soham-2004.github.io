I am an incoming freshman at the [California Institute of Technology](https://caltech.edu) and a current high school senior at Lotus Valley International School, Gurugram. I am deeply passionate about mathematics and computer Science. My research interests include time series analyses, computational geometry and dynamic systems modelling. When I'm not working, I tend to read books, articles and surf the Wikipedia.

On-going Projects
------
Expanding on my work in the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences' Summer Research School, I am currently working on an interactive web-app that visualises the placement of objects in a 2D Bin Packing Problem using a [Multi-start Genetic Algorithm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-48056-5_12). Secondly, I am also workiing on using sentiment analysis with the [NLTK library](https://www.nltk.org/) to analyse public political and economic opinion trends over the years.  

Research Work
------
A complete summary of my research work can be found in the [CV section](https://amitesh2624.github.io/cv), but over the years, I have worked on policy data analysis and handling governmental data, formulating policy recommendations on the basis of statistical inferences for [The World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/), analysing approximate and optimal solutions to NP-Hard problems such as the 2DBPP using genetic algorithms as part of the [Bulgarian Academy of Sciences](https://bas.bg), and analyse privacy frameworks, verifiable credentials, and global COVID control and monetary strategies' data for the [MIT PathCheck Foundation](https://www.pathcheck.org/).

Other Interests and Extracurricular Engagement
------
I try to remain politically active and a responsible citizen of India. In my free time, I write blogs on my stance on various political and economic debates. I also like to play classical music on my Cordoba C7 nylon string guitar (highly recommended for intermediate players). I am currently reading "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" by James Joyce, a book I have given up on multiple times in the past.
