I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science and Economics at the [California Institute of Technology](https://caltech.edu). I am passionate about machine learning, statistics and mathematical economics. My research interests include time series analyses, computational geometry and dynamical systems modelling.

On-going Projects
------
Expanding on my work with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences' Summer Research School, I am currently working on an interactive web-app that visualises the placement of objects in the 2D Bin Packing Problem using a [Multi-start Genetic Algorithm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-48056-5_12). Secondly, I am also working on using sentiment analysis with the [NLTK library](https://www.nltk.org/) in Python to analyse public political and economic opinion trends over the years, in particular after major international political events. 

Research Work
------
A complete summary of my research work can be found in the [publications](https://amitesh2624.github.io/publications) section, but over the years, I have worked on using data to drive policy design. I have grown an expertise in handling governmental data, formulating policy recommendations on the basis of statistical inferences as a result of my work for [The World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/), analysing approximate and optimal solutions to NP-Hard problems such as the 2DBPP using genetic algorithms as part of the [Bulgarian Academy of Sciences](https://bas.bg), and analysing privacy frameworks, verifiable credentials, and global COVID control and monetary strategies for the [MIT PathCheck Foundation](https://www.pathcheck.org/).
